# GO Fiber API + MongoDB + Redis + Docker

Plans for now
- Setup CRUD for user
- Add other routes
- Implement caching using Redis

Run `docker-compose up` and test it on your machine.

Run app locally
- `cd fiber-mongo-api`
- `go run main.go --seed`

Please provide your feedback, it would help me grow. Thanks
